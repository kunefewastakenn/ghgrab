**ghgrab** provides a streamlined command-line interface for cherry-picking specific files or folders from any GitHub repository, powered by the Rust `tokio` and `ratatui` ecosystem. Focused on speed and ease of use, it offers a beautiful TUI that lets you grab exactly what you need; all without the wait times of a full `git clone`.

## Why use ghgrab?

- **No more clone-and-delete**: Grab exactly what you need, when you need it.
- **Easy on the eyes**: A clean terminal interface that makes browsing feel smooth.
- **Works where you are**: Installs quickly via NPM, Cargo, or PIP.
- **Find things fast**: Quickly search and navigate through any repo's folders with fuzzy search.
- **Handles the big stuff**: Built-in support for GitHub LFS (Large File Storage).
- **Batch mode**: Select a bunch of files and folders to download them all at once.

## Installation

### NPM
```bash
npm install -g @ghgrab/ghgrab
```

### Cargo
```bash
cargo install ghgrab
```

### pipx (Recommended for Python)
```bash
pipx install ghgrab
```

---

### Quick Start

Just type `ghgrab` to start browsing:

```bash
ghgrab
```

Or, if you already have a link, just paste it in:

```bash
# Browse a repository
ghgrab https://github.com/rust-lang/rust

# Download to current directory directly
ghgrab https://github.com/rust-lang/rust --cwd --no-folder
```

### CLI Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--cwd` | Forces download to the current working directory. |
| `--no-folder` | Downloads files directly without creating a subfolder for the repo. |
| `--token <TOKEN>`| Use a specific GitHub token for this run (doesn't save to settings). |

### Configuration

To manage your settings:

```bash
# Set your token
ghgrab config set token YOUR_TOKEN

# Set a custom download folder
ghgrab config set path "/your/custom/path"

# View your current settings (token is masked)
ghgrab config list

# Remove settings
ghgrab config unset token
ghgrab config unset path
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts (How to move around)

We've kept it pretty standard, but here's a quick cheat sheet:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` / `l` / `Right` | Enter directory or Submit URL |
| `Backspace` / `h` / `Left` | Go back to previous folder |
| `Delete` | Clear URL input (Home page) |
| `Tab` | Auto-fill `https://github.com/` (Home page) |
| `/` | Start Searching (File list) |
| `Esc` | **Exit Search** or **Return Home** (file list) or **Quit** (home screen) |
| `q` / `Q` | **Quit** (from file list) |
| `Ctrl+q` | **Force Quit** (anywhere) |
| `Space` | Toggle selection for the current item |
| `a` | Select All items |
| `u` | Unselect all items |
